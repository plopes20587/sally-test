### Project structure

We've already prepared everything you need to kickstart your project. The main dependencies like `radium` and `material-ui` are already set up. you can start write your code inside the `AppContainer` component which is in the `./src/components/templates/AppContainer/` folder.

### What you need to know

#### Component Structure

We're using `atomic design pattern` for structuring our React components. You can find more about it [here](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). If you're not familiar with it and it would take you to much time to implement it you can structure your project however you like. Just keep it clean.

#### Styling

Because of the usage of the `material-ui` library the best way for styling those components is via inline styles. Therefore to keep the styling consistent we're using the `radium` library which provides us with a more flexible way of styling components via inline styles. You can find more about `radium` [here](http://formidable.com/open-source/radium/).

### Assignment

You will have to create a small CRUD application which will mainly consist of a table and a modal for editing the data. You can find the UI design in the assets folder (ops4-test-project.xd [Assignment window] or Assignment.png).

#### Data

In `./src/api/` folder you will find `rentals.api.js`, `drivers.api.js` and `vehicles.api.js` which mimic an API call. All these functions will return a `Promise` object so feel free to use either `async / await` or `Promises`.

#### Rentals Table

This table is only for data presentation.

What you need to take care of:
- In the header the total number of rows should be visible
- When a user types someting into the search field it should immediately trigger a search function. It should be searchable by the following fields: `vehicle brand`, `driver first_name`, `driver last_name` and `driver email`
- The table should be sorted by the rentals `start_date` attribute
- The statuses should be in their respective colors (reserved - dark red, returned - purple, ...)
- If a columns is empty (missing data) it should render `- (minus)` sign
- Clicking on a table row should open up the edit modal

#### Edit Modal

This modal should take care for editing or deleting the date.

What you need to take care of:
- The modal should be in the center of the browsers viewport
- Header color should match the state that the rental is in
- Headers title should be the brand of the vehicle
- Headers sub title should be the state of the rental
- The `start_date` and `end_date` are date attributes and you can implement them either with a date & time picker or a normal input field. Just make sure that the display value should be in `MM.DD.YY HH:mma` format and inside the object it should be in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`.
- Status field shuld be a drop down with the following values: `reserved, active, returned and archived`.
- Every field except the `email` and the `end_date` is required and can not be empty. Also check if the user inserted a proper email. Let the user know that he made a mistake uppon `SAVE` click.
- The `DELETE` button should remove the rental from the rentals table

#### Additional information

You may use any thirdparty npm module. Use whatever makes your life easier :) UX is important so pay attention to it. Let us know if you have any questions.
